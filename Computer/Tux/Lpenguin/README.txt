The unofficial 3D Linux Penguin VERSION 1.0                          29-sept-99
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This zip-archive should contain the following:

	sitting.3ds		The sitting penguin model	
	standing.3ds		The standing penguin model
	whitespo.gif		Texture for penguin body
	eyelids.gif		Texture for pengiun eyes
	nostrils.tga		Texture for penguin beak
	black.gif		Single black pixel
	README.txt		You're reading it

These are the first versions of the model I'm putting on-line. The standing
penguin is made out of multiple parts, so you can manualy change its pose a
bit. The sitting penguin is converted to one solid model. The flippers of 
the sitting penguin modle aren't the real thing yet, but they probably will 
be more realistic in the next version.      

For questions, requests or remarks mail me.
